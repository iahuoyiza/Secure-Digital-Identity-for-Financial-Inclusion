# Secure Digital Identity for Financial Inclusion

A blockchain-based platform empowering unbanked populations with verifiable digital identities for secure financial service access.

## Overview

This decentralized system addresses the global challenge of financial exclusion by providing individuals without traditional identification with secure digital identities they control. Built on blockchain technology, our platform enables the unbanked to establish verifiable credentials, access appropriate financial services, and build financial historiesâ€”all while maintaining privacy and security of personal information.

## Core Components

### Identity Creation Contract
- Establishes self-sovereign digital IDs for underserved populations
- Implements privacy-preserving biometric verification techniques
- Creates unique cryptographic identifiers with user-controlled private keys
- Enables identity recovery through social mechanisms and trusted parties
- Maintains immutable identity creation records with minimal personal data

### Credential Issuance Contract
- Records verified identity attributes from trusted credential issuers
- Implements selective disclosure protocols for privacy protection
- Manages different trust levels for various types of verification
- Stores cryptographic proofs of verification without raw personal data
- Enables revocation and updating of credentials when necessary

### Service Access Contract
- Connects users with appropriate financial services based on credentials
- Implements consent-based sharing of identity information
- Manages service provider registration and verification
- Creates audit trails of service access authorizations
- Enables progressive service access as users build financial histories

### Transaction History Contract
- Builds financial reputation through verified transaction records
- Implements privacy-preserving reputation scoring algorithms
- Enables users to share selective transaction history for credit assessment
- Creates tamper-proof records of financial activities and repayments
- Provides verifiable financial credentials for service progression
